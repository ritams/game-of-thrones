## 2. Basic Model and Methods

### 2.1 Model Foundation & Assumptions

#### Agent-Based Framework
- **Population size**: N interacting agents in closed system
- **Binary issue structure**: Two possible stances on contentious topics (e.g., abortion policy)
- **Continuous opinion space**: Agent opinions x_i ∈ (-∞, ∞) allow nuanced positions
- **Opinion interpretation**: Sign indicates stance direction, magnitude shows conviction level
- **Extremism measurement**: Larger |x_i| values represent more radical positions

#### Activity-Driven Network Dynamics
- **Temporal interactions**: Time-varying network structure A_ij(t)
- **Active agent influence**: Only active agents can influence others at each timestep
- **Empirical basis**: Activity distribution based on real social media data patterns

### 2.2 Mathematical Framework

#### Activity Distribution
**Equation**: F(a) = (1-γ)/(1-ε^(1-γ)) × a^(-γ)
- **Activity parameter**: a represents agent engagement level
- **Minimum activity**: ε = 10^(-2) (baseline engagement floor)
- **Steepness control**: γ = 2.1 (empirically determined from social media data)
- **Power-law structure**: Reflects heavy-tailed distribution of user activity

#### Core Opinion Dynamics
**Main Equation**: ẋ_i = -x_i + K(Σ_j A_ij(t) tanh(αx_j))
- **Decay term**: -x_i represents natural opinion fade without reinforcement
- **Social influence**: K > 0 controls strength of peer interactions
- **Controversy factor**: α > 0 modulates issue controversialness
- **Interaction matrix**: A_ij(t) = 1 if agent j influences agent i at time t, 0 otherwise
- **Saturation function**: tanh(αx_j) prevents infinite opinion growth

#### Network Formation Rules
- **Connection count**: Active agent i connects to m other agents
- **Reciprocity factor**: r ∈ [0,1] determines mutual influence probability
- **Weighted selection**: Connections chosen according to homophily probability P_ij

### 2.3 Homophily Mechanism

#### Interaction Probability Formula
**Equation**: P_ij = |x_i - x_j|^(-β) / Σ_k |x_i - x_k|^(-β)
- **Homophily factor**: β quantifies similarity preference strength
- **β = 0**: No interaction preference (random connections)
- **β > 0**: Agents with similar opinions more likely to interact
- **Power-law decay**: Connection probability decreases with opinion distance
- **Normalization**: Denominator ensures probability distribution sums to 1

#### Network Parameter Set
- **Topology parameters**: (ε, γ, m, β, r) fully specify network dynamics
- **Issue parameters**: (K, α) characterize the controversial topic
- **Combined parameter space**: Seven-dimensional parameter space determines system behavior

### 2.4 Asymptotic States

#### Three Distinct Equilibrium Outcomes

**Neutral Consensus State**
- **Condition**: Social interaction K sufficiently small
- **Behavior**: All agent opinions decay to zero (x_i → 0 for all i)
- **Interpretation**: Issue loses relevance, agents become neutral

**Radicalization State**
- **Condition**: Large K but small β (strong interaction, weak homophily)
- **Behavior**: All agents adopt same stance (same sign) with potentially different convictions
- **Absorbing property**: Once achieved, system cannot escape this state
- **Mechanism**: Statistical fluctuations drive entire population to one side

**Polarized State**
- **Condition**: Both K and β large (strong interaction and homophily)
- **Behavior**: Bimodal opinion distribution with two distinct peaks
- **Meta-stability**: State can persist but may transition under perturbations
- **Echo chamber signature**: Network segregation into opinion-based clusters

### **Figure Reference**: `polarization_definition.pdf`
**Caption Summary**: Schematic illustration of three polarization measures: Δ̄ (distance between mean positive and negative opinions), Δ_peak (distance between distribution peaks), and σ (standard deviation of opinion distribution). This figure establishes the quantitative framework for measuring polarization effects.

## 3. Random Nudges and Polarization

### 3.1 Echo Chamber Formation Mechanism

#### Algorithmic Amplification

- **Engagement optimization**: Higher engagement achieved through familiar content
- **Homophily reinforcement**: Natural similarity preference amplified by algorithmic recommendations

#### Intervention Strategy Philosophy
- **Engagement preservation**: Maintain platform attractiveness while increasing diversity
- **Privacy protection**: No need to interpret or analyze user opinions
- **Non-invasive approach**: Subtle modifications to recommendation algorithms
- **Scalable implementation**: Applicable across different platform architectures

### 3.2 Random Nudge Implementation

#### Modified Interaction Probability
**Intervention Equation**: P̃_ij = p × 1/(N-1) + (1-p) × P_ij
- **Nudge probability**: p ∈ [0,1] controls intervention strength
- **Random component**: p × 1/(N-1) ensures uniform connection probability
- **Preserved homophily**: (1-p) × P_ij maintains natural similarity preference
- **Balance mechanism**: Trade-off between diversity and user preference

#### Implementation Characteristics

- **Diversity injection**: Random connections break echo chamber walls

### 3.3 Polarization Measurement Framework

#### Quantitative Measures

**Δ̄ (Mean Separation)**
- **Definition**: Distance between average positive and negative opinions
- **Calculation**: |mean(x_i > 0) - mean(x_i < 0)|
- **Interpretation**: Larger values indicate stronger polarization
- **Sensitivity**: Responsive to overall population stance differences

**Δ_peak (Peak Distance)**
- **Definition**: Distance between two peaks in bimodal distributions
- **Application**: Most relevant when clear bimodal structure exists
- **Measurement**: Identifies local maxima in opinion histogram
- **Limitation**: Requires sufficient bimodality for meaningful measurement

**σ (Standard Deviation)**
- **Definition**: Standard deviation of entire opinion distribution
- **Advantage**: Single metric capturing overall opinion spread
- **Interpretation**: Higher values suggest more diverse opinions
- **Caution**: Can be misleading if distribution has multiple modes

**f_ext (Extreme Opinion Fraction)**
- **Definition**: Fraction of agents with |x_i| > x_th (threshold)
- **Purpose**: Quantifies prevalence of radical positions
- **Threshold dependency**: Results sensitive to x_th choice
- **Radicalization indicator**: Should not increase with beneficial interventions

### **Figure Reference**: `trajectory_figma.pdf`

## 5. Optimizing the Nudge: Polarization versus Radicalization

### 5.1 Radicalization Challenge

#### High Nudge Probability Effects
- **Statistical fluctuation increase**: Large p values introduce excessive randomness
- **Meta-stability loss**: Polarized/depolarized states become unstable
- **Radicalization emergence**: System transitions to unanimous opinion states
- **Lifetime reduction**: Power-law decay in state persistence with increasing p

#### Radicalization Characteristics
- **Absorbing state**: Once achieved, system cannot return to other states
- **Sign uniformity**: All agents adopt same opinion polarity
- **Conviction variation**: Agents may have different conviction levels
- **Undesirable outcome**: Eliminates opinion diversity entirely

### 5.2 Population Fraction Nudging Strategy

#### Modified Intervention Approach
- **Selective nudging**: Only fraction f of population nudged at each time step
- **Random selection**: f-fraction chosen randomly each iteration
- **Preserved natural behavior**: (1-f) fraction follows original homophily dynamics
- **Parameter space expansion**: Two-dimensional optimization over (p, f)

#### Utility Function Formulation
**Linear Utility**: U(Δ̄, f_rad) = Δ̄_tilde + f_rad
- **Normalized polarization**: Δ̄_tilde scaled to [0,1] range
- **Radicalization penalty**: f_rad represents fraction of radicalized realizations
- **Minimization objective**: Lower utility values indicate better outcomes
- **Multi-metric extension**: Same structure applied to Δ_peak and σ measures

### 5.3 Optimization Results

#### Heat Map Analysis
- **Parameter space exploration**: Systematic variation of nudge strength p and population fraction f
- **Utility landscape**: Three heat maps corresponding to different polarization measures
- **Optimal curve identification**: Numerically determined optimal parameter combinations

#### Mathematical Relationship Discovery
**Power-Law Constraint**: p · f^A = B (where A, B are constants)
- **Universal form**: Same functional relationship across all polarization measures
- **Empirical determination**: Constants A and B fitted from optimization results
- **Design guidance**: Practical formula for parameter selection
- **Trade-off quantification**: Mathematical framework for balancing competing objectives

### **Figure Reference**: `opimization.pdf`

#### Second Opinion Dynamics Model
**Sine-Based Dynamics**: ẋ_i(t) = |x_i|sin(x_i^0 - x_i) + K(Σ_j A_ij(t) sin(x_i - x_j))
- **Initial opinion influence**: x_i^0 term represents agent's original position
