In this unit, multiple candidates (colored icons) compete for votes cast by the electorate (black icons). A representative voter casts a ballot for one candidate. The distribution of votes is summarized by key quantities on the right. The \emph {turnout} $T$ (top bar) denotes the number of participating voters and sets the scale of the contest. Among these, the candidate securing the \emph {most votes} ($V_w$, blue) is declared the winner, while the one with the \emph {second-highest votes} ($V_r$, red) is the runner-up. The \emph {margin of victory} $M = V_w - V_r$ (gray) quantifies the degree of competition -- smaller margins reflect tight races, while larger margins indicate strong consensus. This template abstracts the first-past-the-post electoral mechanism used in countries like India, the UK, and the USA, and serves as the basis for analyzing competitiveness and engagement across electoral units}{figure.caption.13}{}}
