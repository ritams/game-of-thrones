# Game of Thrones


Hey let's plan the thesis:


What is the overall flow?
- Abstract -- overarching theme and results over all the projects.
- Synopsis -- summary of each chapters
- chapter 1: Introduction
- chapter 2: Designing interventions to reduce polarization
- chapter 3: In the persuit to find universality in elections and RVM
- chapter 4: Random voting model and ...
- chapter 5: Discussion and future direction.

## Introduction (Chapter 1):

- Society as a complex system
- Interactions are differnet spatial and temporal scales
- One of such emergeing aspect is opinion -- which contrary to our belief is a product of our interactions
- Backbone of decision making process -- from choosing a restaurant for dinner date to deciding fate of the country
through elctions or the world, thorugh your decision to get vacinated or decision to work to prevent climate change
- Naturally physicist -- complexity scientist -- statistical physicists were drawn to the study of opinion dynamics 
since 1950s. 
- Simple model inspired by the iSing model, to explaiin consensus, then bit realistic bounded confidence model
then, and other -- 
- these days our opinons are often shaped by algoritms, -- lead to polarization radicalization, echo chamber ---
- Models are important to study and design intervention for building a society with healthy opinon distributions.
- defining a healthy distribution is in itself a challenging task.
- review of the studies for these modebling appraoches.

- In the second chapter we dive deep into designing a simple yet robust intervention mechanism to reduce opinion 
polarization, which we call the random network nudge. you will soon see that RANDOM is kind of the theme my thesis
- from Random network nudge to random voting model.

- in the second part of my thesis we focus on Election which you can think of as a proxy of public opinion towards a 
certain candidate, or a party

- With the overarching goal of understanding the connectioin between opinion and election, and how certan adverse 
situations in public opinions is detrimental to the health of a democrcay, the finally to build tools and design interventions to help fostering safe elections

- We first seek to discover robust universal patterns in election
- why important?? -- physicist loves universlity
- From a social science or complexity science perspective -- underlying order in the midst of apperant chaos of 
elections
- a bit of history and why they are not robust
- big problems ? finding universlity - model to explain those - predictive power - usefulness to society.



## Towards designing intervention to reduce polarization. (chapter 2 -- opinion dynamics paper)
- intro connecting from introduction. start with why understanding opinion dynamics is important as discussed in the previous chapter. 
- the dive deep into how electronic media is shaping our opinion and often for the worst. 
- the need for better recommender engines.

- Start with a model -- and it's features. fig.
- define polarization -- fig.
- intervention design -- schematic?
- results.
- optimization
- discussions and outlook. potential impact for elections.


## Election data and it's complexity (chapter 2, content part of universal statistics paper and turnout paper, mostly supplemental material other content to be added later)
- Basic template of an Election
- All about data
- the difficulties, and the process.

## In the persute to discover universality in electioins and RVM - the introduction (chapter 4, part of universal statistics paper)

- Pivot but still maintain the overall context
- Why universality-- why complexity -- why physists love it.--- already in the  intro?
- potential to understand the complexity of elections.
- attempts to find
- why they are not great successes.


- The motivation to choose Margin and turnout and there combination
- Why margin / turout is important
- And what we see is a robust universality 
- Let's build the simplest model to describe this.
- Let's solve the model
- Wow the solution and the simulation is a great match with the data.
- How is it useful though ? -- a bit of a hint that deviation might mean something..
- A short discussion about how is this important. and why? -- underlying order. Randomness rules.


## RVM and ... (chapter 5, detailed analysis of RVM, start with coarse grain statistics like margin then move to v_w and v_r and others, turnout and universal statistics paper)
- Predictions are good.. what have people done for predictioin
- can RVM predict?
- solve RVM 
- Margin at diffenent scales
- Winner  and runner up diffent number of candidates.
- Detecting electoral malpractice.
- Long discussion.

## Discussions and future outlook. (chapter 6)
